# Reggee.me-2.0
As a university project, Sam Adams, Ayman Jeewa, George Langham and Bethany Tibbles-Hammond are adding new functionality to an existing system.

To this end, we developed a Timetable Management System for Teachers to use to set sessions, and students to view-only their timetable data.

We also began development on using Charts and Graphs to represent student data for the teacher, though this was not fully implemented.

Main Files Stored in Sessions Folder /pdp/ReggeeMe%20Code/sessions
