# Reggee.me-2.0
As a university project, Sam Adams[@b4020372](//github.com/b4020372), Ayman Jeewa ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayman-jeewa-972576113/)), George Langham[@GeorgeWL](//github.com/GeorgeWL) and Bethany Tibbles-Hammond[@beth1991](//github.com/beth1991) are adding new functionality to an existing system.

To this end, we developed a Timetable Management System for Teachers to use to set sessions, and students to view-only their timetable data.

We also began development on using Charts and Graphs to represent student data for the teacher, though this was not fully implemented.
